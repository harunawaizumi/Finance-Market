Incorporated, that means it's made as if it has a body.
The for-profit exists for shareholders.
The non-profit exists for whatever the charter of the non-profit says,
* non-profit: they make profits. they don't distribute profits to shareholders.

- Shares and Dividends
Divdends: break a share into 2 etc.
 In the United States, by tradition, the target price per share is something like $30 a share.
The price goes down when the company pays the dividends.
